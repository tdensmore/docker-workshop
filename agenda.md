# HEB Workshop

# **Build, Run, Deploy: a Full-Stack App with Spring Boot, AngularJS, and PostgreSQL**

## **Workshop Description:**

In this hands-on, in-person workshop, developers will gain practical experience building, running, testing, and deploying a full-stack containerized application. Participants will work with a real-world example that combines a **Spring Boot API backend**, an **AngularJS frontend**, and a **PostgreSQL database**, all orchestrated using Docker.

By the end of the session, developers will walk away with a clear understanding of how to:
•	Containerize backend, frontend, and database services
•	Run everything together using Docker Compose
•	Troubleshoot the application locally and prepare it for cloud deployment

This workshop is ideal for developers with some experience in Java or frontend development who are looking to sharpen their DevOps and containerization skills.

* Git
* Docker Desktop

**Languages**
* Java 17 / Maven
