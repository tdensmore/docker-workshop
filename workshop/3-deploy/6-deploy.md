## Step 5: Deploying to other environments

The problem with the current `docker-compose.yml` file is that it is only useful for local development.

We need to push our images to a registry so that we can deploy them to other environments, and create a new docker-compose.yml file that uses the images from the registry.

### Push images to a registry

By default, docker will push to Docker Hub. If you want to push to a different registry, you can tag the image with the registry name.

```bash
docker tag myapp:latest myregistry.com/myapp:latest
docker push myregistry.com/myapp:latest
```

You can then deploy the image to any environment that has access to the registry.

### Update docker-compose.yml

Update the docker-compose.yml file to use the image from the registry.

```yaml
services:
  backend:
    image: myregistry.com/backend:latest
    container_name: backend
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
```

### Local registry

To spin up a local registry for testing, you can use the registry-compose.yml file.

```bash
docker-compose -f registry-compose.yml up -d
```

This will start a local registry on your machine. You can then push your images to this registry and deploy them to other environments.

Example:
```bash
docker tag myapp:latest localhost:8090/myapp:latest
docker push localhost:8090/myapp:latest
docker rmi localhost:8090/myapp:latest
docker pull localhost:8090/myapp:latest
```

### Deploying to a Kubernetes cluster

You can use `compose-bridge convert` to convert your docker-compose.yml file to a Kubernetes deployment.

```bash
compose-bridge convert -f docker-compose.yml -o k8s-deployment
```

This will create a k8s-deployment.yaml file that you can use to deploy to a Kubernetes cluster.

You can deploy to a Kubernetes cluster using the `kubectl` command. 

```bash
kubectl apply -k k8s-deployment/overlays/desktop
kubectl get ns
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=docker-workshop
kubectl get pods
kubectl get svc
kubectl get deploy
kubectl port-forward svc/frontend-published 8080:80
```

### Debugging

```bash
kubectl get pods
kubectl describe pod [podname]
kubectl logs [podname] -p # the -p option will read the logs of the previous (crashed) instance
```
