# Solution: CDE

CDEs (Cloud Development Environments or Containerized Development Environments) are a way to programmatically describe a consistent development environment using containers. This allows you to provide the tools and SDKs needed to develop and test code using an IDE in a consistent way across different development environments. 

## Development Containers

The .devcontainer directory includes a Development Container configuration that allows you to work on both the Spring Boot backend and Angular frontend in a consistent, containerized environment.

## Prerequisites

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) for VS Code

## Getting Started

1. Open VS Code
2. Clone this repository
3. Open the repository folder in VS Code
4. When prompted, click "Reopen in Container" or press F1, type "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"
5. Wait for the container to build (this may take a few minutes the first time)

## What's Included

The development container includes:
- Java 17 with Maven for Spring Boot 3.2 development
- Node.js 20 with Angular CLI for Angular 19 development
- PostgreSQL 14 database
- Essential VS Code extensions for Java, Spring Boot, and Angular development

## Working with the Services

### Backend (Spring Boot)

The Spring Boot application is accessible at http://localhost:9090

To run the backend:
```bash
cd /workspace/backend-springboot
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Frontend (Angular)

The Angular application is accessible at http://localhost:4300

To run the frontend with live reload:
```bash
cd /workspace/frontend-angular
npm install
ng serve --host 0.0.0.0
```

### Database (PostgreSQL)

The PostgreSQL database is accessible at:
- Host: postgres
- Port: 5434
- Database: studentdb
- Username: postgres
- Password: postgres

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the development container:

1. Ensure Docker Desktop is running
2. Try rebuilding the container: F1 â†’ "Dev Containers: Rebuild Container"
3. Check the ports are not already in use on your host machine (9090, 4300, 5434)

## Customizing the Dev Container

If you need to customize the development environment:

1. Modify `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` to add VS Code extensions or settings
2. Modify `.devcontainer/Dockerfile` to install additional tools or dependencies
3. Modify `.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml` to change service configurations

After making changes, rebuild the container by pressing F1 and selecting "Dev Containers: Rebuild Container"
